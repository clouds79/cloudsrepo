        </h2>
<p>so what goes here? ig ABOUT ME!</p>
<p> so yeah i go by "clouds",the ones from the sky!
     actually there's really not much interesting things to talk about myself.
        I am an IT undergrad
        was kinda above average in the academics,
        got multiple interests tbh but i think i am just lazy
        but these i days i try!</p>

            <li>singing</li>
            <template>one school teacher always took me in chorus singing competitions,maybe he believed in me in some ways</template>
            <li>pc parts</li>
            <template>i do not have much resources for this rn but i guess it would also be an engaging hobby, i like to watch many tech 
            videos like ltt, dawid des tech stuff, randomgaminginhd,kryzzp etc</template>
            <li>some physics here an there</li>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>HOPES AND DREAMS</h2>
        <p>hmm.. what do i want? guess that that would be subjective, different for everyone! or maybe not so much every just wants to 
        be happy in the end right? but then again happiness is also subjective ig.
            <ul>
                <li>wanna be a harworking person, one whos really passionate about the work</li>
                <li>person with principles,ethics and a very clear mind and perspective</li>
                <li>wanna do type of work which will give me a sense of peace</li>
                <li>big personality?</li>
                <template>honestly i didnt ever thought becoming a very great, i just wanna be who i am</template>
            </ul>

        </p>
